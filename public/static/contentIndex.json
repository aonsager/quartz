One time is good, but two times (or even more?) is fantastic.\nRemove other Epiphany cards\nEach Copy Card event in Chaos randomly selects 3 cards, of which you choose 1 to copy. If you want your target card to appear as one of the choices, one strategy is to remove as many alternatives as possible.\nInstead of removing basic cards right away, you can instead remove other characters’ unique cards. By sacrificing their deck’s strength, you can build one deck to be especially strong.\nThis is easier to pull off after your characters have developed a fair amount, as survival becomes less of an issue.\nUnique cards\nSome characters have cards with the Unique attribute, which means they can’t be copied. Some cards gain Unique from Epiphanies. Since Unique cards will not be chosen as Copy targets, you don’t need to remove them in preparation for Copy events.\nPairing characters with these cards will make it a little bit easier to copy the card you are targeting.\nThe first boss is key\nIt’s much easier to duplicate your target cards at the first boss fight.

I’ll need to update this if mechanics change in the next event.\n\n\nHere are a list of some general tips to farming Chaos to build strong decks for your characters.\nChaos Difficulty\nThe best difficulty to farm is considered to be Difficulty 8, for a few reasons:\n\nEnemy levels increase a lot when moving up to 9\n8 with Nightmare mode gives consistent access to Tier 13-14 save data, which is generally enough to fit the decks you want.\n\nChaos Effects\nSome effects are much easier to manage than others. Things like:\n\nDecrease health (take damage) at beginning of each turn\nIncrease Elite and Boss HP &amp; Damage\nIncrease number of Elite fights\nDecrease max health\n\nare not too bad. Especially for Laboratory 0, the scary monsters who can end your run are actually in normal fights. So choosing Elite fights has a lot of benefits.\nThe bad effects you want to avoid are:\n\nEnemies gain Morale/Fortify after X turns\nEnemies gain Morale/Fortify upon enemy death\n\nbecause these can create impossible fights that will wipe your run.\nReducing credits is fine if you just want to finish the runs, but if you’re trying to build a great deck you need a fair amount of credits to remove cards, buy neutral cards, and buy equipment. So events within Chaos that give credits are pretty valuable.\nChaos Upgrades\nThere is an upgrade in the Chaos system that increases the chance of encountering Rare Species (upgraded versions of normal enemies) by up to 45%. The problem with this is that sometimes the enemies are strong enough to end your run, while the only upside is that you get more Chaos Orbs.\nHowever! If you reset your Chaos Upgrades, all tiers remain unlocked and you can choose which upgrades to enable. And you get all of our Chaos Orbs back.\nSo just reset, and re-enable everything except for the Rare Species probably up.

The card draw was a great help in setting up combos and extending them as much as possible. I have a few good +1AP epiphanies on my Draw cards, so I ended up having a lot of AP left over. I may even be able to drop Mika for Veronica if I ever draw her.\nMy second team remains an unsolved issue, though. I’m going to stick with Renoa + Nia, so if my third is not Cassius then maybe Rei? Or maybe even move Mika over here."},"games/Chaos-Zero-Nightmare/index":{"slug":"games/Chaos-Zero-Nightmare/index","filePath":"games/Chaos Zero Nightmare/index.md","title":"Chaos Zero Nightmare","links":["games/Chaos-Zero-Nightmare/Characters/Mei-Lin","games/Chaos-Zero-Nightmare/Characters/Mika","games/Chaos-Zero-Nightmare/Characters/Renoa","games/Chaos-Zero-Nightmare/Characters/Rei"],"tags":[],"content":"Actively farming characters\n\n  Mei-Lin\n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMemory FragmentsTarget DeckPotentials✅️ 18/18✅️ 2/5 +2✅️ 9/9\nDetails →\n\n  Mika\n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMemory FragmentsTarget DeckPotentials✅️ 18/18✅️ 4/6 +3❌️ 0/4\nDetails →\n\n  Renoa\n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMemory FragmentsTarget DeckPotentials❌️ 4/6❌️❌️\nDetails →\n\n  Rei\n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMemory FragmentsTarget DeckPotentials❌️ 0/6❌️❌️\nDetails →"},"games/index":{"slug":"games/index","filePath":"games/index.md","title":"Games","links":["Games/Chaos-Zero-Nightmare"],"tags":[],"content":"This section of the wiki will be for compiling information about the games I play.\nThis includes reference material, notes on personal progression, and my thoughts about the game experience.\nChaos Zero Nightmare"},"index":{"slug":"index","filePath":"index.md","title":"Invisible Wiki","links":["Games/"],"tags":[],"content":"Hello, and welcome to my website.

Coincidentally, I had just recently come to some similar conclusions at my own workplace, too.\nEffective leaders enable people to solve problems and make progress on their own, so the presence of the best leaders will probably be hard to notice.\nI am reminded of a quote from Lao-Tzu (or at least one version of its translation) that has stuck in my mind:\n\nA leader is best when people barely know he exists. When his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: We did it ourselves.\n\nI would often place myself as a middle man in communications deliberately, especially when I was invested in the communication and the other parties involved were also busy doing other things at the same time. The intent was that I could steer the conversation to an efficient consensus, by framing the discussions and paraphrasing or summarizing (what I thought to be) the important points.\nIn reality though, I was often doing more harm than good.\nBy placing myself in the middle of communications, I make myself a bottleneck. If I was busy doing something else, I might delay responses, and it was often faster to just have the two people talk to each other directly.\nAnd when I put information through my own filter of what I felt was important or not, It’s too easy to get the nuance wrong. Even if things seemed to work out at the time, small differences in understanding can compound over time and turn into a bigger problem in the future. In these cases too, I think now that it’s more effective to just have everyone speak to each other directly.\nOf course, not everyone can be talking to everyone else all the time, and determining how much is too much might be an area where my input could help. But in general, I’m trying very hard not to speak for other people, and am trying instead to be someone who can connect people to each other quickly and efficiently."}}
