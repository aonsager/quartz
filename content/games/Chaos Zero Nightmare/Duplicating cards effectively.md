A lot of characters benefit greatly from having a key card duplicated as many times as possible. One time is good, but two times (or even more?) is fantastic.

Each Copy Card event in Chaos randomly selects 3 cards, of which you choose 1 to copy. If you want your target card to appear as one of the choices, one strategy is to remove as many alternatives as possible.

Instead of removing basic cards right away, instead remove other characters' unique cards. By sacrificing their deck's strength, you can build one deck to be especially strong.

## Unique cards

Some characters have cards with the Unique attribute, which means they can't be copied. Some cards gain Unique from Epiphanies. Since Unique cards will not be chosen as Copy targets, you don't need to remove them in preparation for Copy events. 

Pairing characters with these cards will make it a little bit easier to copy the card you are targeting.
