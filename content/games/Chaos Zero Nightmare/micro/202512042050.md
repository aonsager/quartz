[[Renoa]] is pretty good now, but it sounds like she is getting pretty significant buffs/fixes. 

Up until now, her 3-1 and 7 potentials, which increased the strength of Dirge Bullet, had not been applied to the discard effect. 

In addition, the [[Conqueror's Aspect]] set bonus will also start applying to Dirge Bullet. So that's a flat 35% damage increase, as well as a 35% boost to crit damage. Insane!
