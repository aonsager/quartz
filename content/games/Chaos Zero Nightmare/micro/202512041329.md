[[Chizuru]] is interesting, but doesn't really add anything new to my lineup since [[Mei-Lin]] is already strong single-target.

Obvious synergy is with [[Rin]] and [[Tressa]], and I don't have either of them built. Shame that [[Renoa]]'s bullet discard doesn't trigger Will-o-wisp.

A strong multi-target attacker is probably what I need, and that makes me wonder if I should have just pulled [[Yuki]]. But using her in her showcase was kind of underwhelming and I'm not sold on the character design either. 

So I think I need to just resist the FOMO and wait for someone I can really get behind.
