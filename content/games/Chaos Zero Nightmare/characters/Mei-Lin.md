## Target Deck (2/5 +2)


> [!NOTE] Playstyle
> Aggressive Mutant + Confiscation lets me keep using Forbidden: Violence, which quickly becomes 0-cost because of all of the card draw. 
> This interaction then fuels a powerful Rising Dragon Spire.
> 
> Better versions of Unity of Attack would have been really nice.
