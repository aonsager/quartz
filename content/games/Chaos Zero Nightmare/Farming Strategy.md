Here are a list of some general tips to farming Chaos to build strong decks for your characters.

# Chaos Difficulty

The best difficulty to farm is considered to be Difficulty 8, for a few reasons:

1. Enemy levels increase a lot when moving up to 9
2. 8 with Nightmare mode gives consistent access to Tier 13-14 save data, which is generally enough to fit the decks you want.

# Chaos Effects

Some effects are much easier to manage than others. Things like:

- Decrease health (take damage) at beginning of each turn
- Increase Elite and Boss HP & Damage
- Increase number of Elite fights
- Decrease max health

are not too bad. Especially for Laboratory 0, the scary monsters who can end your run are actually in normal fights. So choosing Elite fights has a lot of benefits.

The bad effects you want to avoid are:

- Enemies gain Morale/Fortify after X turns
- Enemies gain Morale/Fortify upon enemy death

because these can create impossible fights that will wipe your run.

Reducing credits is fine if you just want to finish the runs, but if you're trying to build a great deck you need a fair amount of credits to remove cards, buy neutral cards, and buy equipment. So events within Chaos that give credits are pretty valuable.

# Deck Building
