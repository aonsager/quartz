In addition to using this site as a general wiki for my thoughts, I'm eyeing the possibility of migrating my entire blog to this format. I Currently make my site with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) (a great product!) but I have a lot of customization living in each post's frontmatter, and while I do have a variety of convenience scripts set up, I kind of need to be sitting at my desktop machine in order to create and publish posts. 

With Quartz, I just add a new file somewhere, slap on a few words, and it's already a part of my website. I want to see if there is a way to stay within this dead-simple workflow, and somehow recreate the functionality of my current site.
