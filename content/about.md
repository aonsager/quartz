My name is Alex. I grew up near Boulder, CO and spent most of my childhood reading books, playing music, and playing video games. I learned programming by making bad games for my TI-83 calculator. The first things I published online were bad flash websites.

In college I studied programming and human-computer interaction. A team of classmates and I made [a few apps](http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/These-Stanford-Students-Made-Millions-Taking-A-2361888.php) on Facebook, which eventually turned into a startup. This was the first time I made something that was used by a large number of people. It became my introduction to making real products that have users and make money.

I have been working at a mobile game company in Japan since 2010. Because my day-job doesn't currently involve much programming, I like to work on [fun projects](https://invisibleparade.com/projects) on the side that let me build things directly.

Part of the reason I maintain this blog is the hope that it will help me make more connections online. Please feel free to [get in touch](https://invisibleparade.com/contact)! It would make me very happy.
