Quartz [automatically generates index pages for folders](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/features/folder-and-tag-listings), and shows a list of all pages under that folder. 

You can create your own index.md file to change the title and add any content you want, but disabling the list of pages was not as easy.

I ended up editing `FolderContent.txs` directly, to look for an option called `hideFolderContent` in the page frontmatter.

```typescript
// check if folder content should be displayed according to frontmatter
const showFolderContent: boolean =
	fileData.frontmatter?.hideFolderContent !== true
	
[. . .]

return (
	<div class="popover-hint">
        <article class={classes}>{content}</article>
        {showFolderContent && (
	        <div class="page-listing">
	          {options.showFolderCount && (
	            <p>
	              {i18n(cfg.locale).pages.folderContent.itemsUnderFolder({
	                count: allPagesInFolder.length,
	              })}
	            </p>
	          )}
	          <div>
	            <PageList {...listProps} />
	          </div>
	        </div>
        )}
	</div>
)
```

This wraps the portion of the page that shows folder content in a conditional, which can be toggled off by adding a variable to any page's frontmatter.
